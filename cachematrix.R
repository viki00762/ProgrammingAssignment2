## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

##  This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv = NULL
  set = function(y) {
    # use `<<-` to assign a value to an object in an environment 
    # different from the current environment. 
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get = function() x
  setinv = function(inverse) inv <<- inverse 
  getinv = function() inv
  list(set=set, get=get, setinv=setinv, getinv=getinv)

}


## his function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  ## @x: output of makeCacheMatrix()
  ## return: inverse of the original matrix input to makeCacheMatrix()
  
  inv = x$getinv()
  
  # if the inverse has already been calculated
  if (!is.null(inv)){
    # get it from the cache and skips the computation. 
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  
  # otherwise, calculates the inverse 
  mat.data = x$get()
  inv = solve(mat.data, ...)
  
  # sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.
  x$setinv(inv)
  
  return(inv)
}
